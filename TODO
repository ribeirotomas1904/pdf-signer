I THINK I NEED TO CANCEL RENDER SO I DONT TRIGGER TWO AT ONCE WHEN ZOOMING TOO QUICKLY, SEE HOW TO CANCEL RENDER ON PDFJS

 
WHEN CLOSE TO THE SCREEN BORDER AND DRAGGING A SIGNATURE, THE SCREEN SHOULD MOVE THERE
INSERT SIGNATURE ON CURRENT CANVAS AND POSITION
WHEN I MOVE TOO FAST, IT DOESNT RENDER
I SEE ARTIFACTS WHEN MOVING A BIT FAST
PAGES FLICKER ON MOVING
EXISTING SIGNATURES FOR SELECTION ARE OVERFLOWING, AND THE SIGNATURE PAD IS NOT BIG ENOUGH ON MOBILE
IMPROVE THE RESOLUTION IN WHICH EVERY IMG IS DRAWN ON THE PDF FILE
