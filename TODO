WHEN I MOVE TOO FAST, IT DOESNT RENDER, THATS BECAUSE OF MY IS_RENDERING CHECK    
I SEE ARTIFACTS WHEN MOVING A BIT FAST

-- INSERT SIGNATURE ON VISIBLE POSITION ON CURRENT CANVA
-- DONT USE GLOBAL VARIABLES INSIDE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE NOT EVENT HANDLERS, AND IN THE EVENT HANDLER, COPY IT BEFORE USING IT

MOVE SIGNATURE DOWN WHEN CLOSE TO VIEWPORT BORDER


there will be a function that actives the scroll 
and another that deactivate the scroll

it will be activated when clicking on signature if it's close to the border, or when moving the mouse while pressing the selectedSignature close to the border

it will deactivate when moving away from the border or when release the pointer from the selectedSignature


it can be activated when clicked

it can be deactivated when release (it should also update its position)
