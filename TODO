what happens to all canvases if mobile orientation is changed?

what should be the default size of a signature in relation to the pdf?

# IMPLEMENT DOWNLOAD PDF, TO TEST IF I CAN SAVE IT WITH SVG SIGNATURES

TODO: make css pixels ints like the actual canvas size, remember to test what are the values of width the canvas have compared to styles
to check how the actual canvas size is being rounded

CHANGE ZOOM/WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE 100 ZOOM, IN ORDER SO USERS DONT HAVE TO SCROLL SIDES ONCE LOADING THE PAGE

REMEMBER TO CHNAGE SIGNATURE PAD CONFIG TO DRAW BETTER, MORE OFTEN



HANDLE ZOOM CHANGING ON BROWSER, because that changes device pixel ratio





REMOVE ALL GLOBAL VARIABLES ACCESSES FROM FUNCTIONS AND ACCESS THEM ONLY ON EVENT HANDLERS

I THINK I NEED TO CANCEL RENDER SO I DONT TRIGGER TWO AT ONCE WHEN ZOOMING TOO QUICKLY, SEE HOW TO CANCEL RENDER ON PDFJS



DEAL WITH WINDOWS RESIZE AND ZOOM AND ORIENTATION CHANGE



FOR NOW IM IGNORING CROPBOX, ROTATION AND DIFFERENT SIZES ACROSS PDF JS AND PDF LIB

IM ASSUMING ALL PDF PAGES HAVE THE SAME WIDTH FOR NOW


FIX MOVING SIGNATURE ON MOBILE
IMPLEMENT CONTEXTUAL MENU FOR SIGNATURE






when close to the screen border and dragging a signature, the screen should move there
make so i can move signatures between PAGES

when i click on limpar or criar after signing, the buttons dont work sometimes
