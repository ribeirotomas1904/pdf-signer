what happens to all canvases if mobile orientation is changed?

TODO: make css pixels ints like the actual canvas size, remember to test what are the values of width the canvas have compared to styles
to check how the actual canvas size is being rounded

REMEMBER TO CHNAGE SIGNATURE PAD CONFIG TO DRAW BETTER, MORE OFTEN

HANDLE ZOOM CHANGING ON BROWSER, because that changes device pixel ratio

REMOVE ALL GLOBAL VARIABLES ACCESSES FROM FUNCTIONS AND ACCESS THEM ONLY ON EVENT HANDLERS

I THINK I NEED TO CANCEL RENDER SO I DONT TRIGGER TWO AT ONCE WHEN ZOOMING TOO QUICKLY, SEE HOW TO CANCEL RENDER ON PDFJS

DEAL WITH WINDOWS RESIZE AND ZOOM AND ORIENTATION CHANGE

when close to the screen border and dragging a signature, the screen should move there

when pressing on the signature and scrolling with the wheel, the position of the signature should be updated

IMPLEMENT CONTEXTUAL MENU FOR SIGNATURE
- insert signature on current canvas and position
